I am a passionate Full Stack Developer working with JavaScript/React, Ruby/Rails & Python. I write [Test-Driven](#test-driven-development) code which I strive to keep as DRY and readable as possible. 


- Functional knowledge of numerous programming languages gained both from professional experience and through extensive coursework and project completion, as well as a proficient understanding of development strategies and application development.
- Skilled at teamwork and effective communication, with strong experience establishing workflows and talent driving teams to deliver timely project results.
- Practised in stakeholder and client communication, as well as career experience with business process development, requirements engineering, and business analysis.

My top priority in finding a company to work at is to find a nurturing home for my skillset where I can grow as a developer and, most importantly, learn from talented teammates.

## Skills

### Empathetic and Effective Communicator

My mum has always said that, as a child, she could ‘take me anywhere’ – even as a two-year-old she would find me chatting away to anyone and everyone. This is one of the traits I value most in myself and others and means I excel when working closely with people in a team.

I'm not afraid to ask for help when I need it and relish the opportunity to get [feedback](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13bFI4rzXKgMMz6S4yJiGhePCpK7UMnHF/view?usp=sharing) on my work. 

- Designed and delivered communication training for teams of around 20 people to aid in the transition of a major banking project from London to Leeds.
- I have also started and supported teams that dealt exclusively with the most difficult of a project’s cases - those involving the family of deceased customers, in particular, requiring tact and care.

### Adaptable and a Fast Learner

With regulatory compliance contracts lasting anywhere from three months to two years, often with multiple workstreams on a single contract, one of the most valuable skills I have is the ability to learn a new set of complex regulations, systems and products quickly and thoroughly. 

My ability to do this was **quantifiably tested**, with work being submitted to regular & thorough quality control checks. These **never dipped below 95%**.

- My brother and I saw a gap in the market for a podcast focusing on the less well-known but no less fascinating people in the entertainment industry so I set about learning how to run a podcast.
- We started the Up & Coming podcast last year with no prior experience in podcasting and Season 1 has garnered thousands of listens to date. We are currently working on Season 2 and receiving requests for guest appearances.

### Test-Driven Development

Test-Driven Development is my preferred way to write code. I have used it since I first learned to code and it is second nature for me to use TDD when solving complex problems. 
- I continue to undergo regular assessment of my TDD process and have had 10 code reviews focused on this with an independent assessment company via Makers. This is **more than almost anyone else** the reviewers are aware of. I can provide examples of feedback from these sessions on request.
