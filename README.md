I am a passionate Full Stack Developer working with Python, JavaScript/React & Ruby/Rails. I write [Test Driven code](#test-driven-development) which I strive to keep as DRY and readable as possible. 

See some of the projects I have built/am building in my portfolio: [bgittins.com](https://bgittins.com/).

I'm currently helping an NPO, Gigfunding, to build a customer-facing skill sharing marketplace (which uses a customised version of a large, open source Rails project). I delivered all must-have tickets on time for live user testing deadline of 06/06/20. 

I joined Gigfunding on a voluntary basis with the aim of learning from a team of experienced developers while contributing to a worthwhile project. The experience of writing code in a production environment has been extremely beneficial after finishing Makers Academy. 

I’m now looking for a nurturing home for my skillset where I can grow as a developer and learn from talented teammates. 

- Languages & tech include JavaScript, React, Ruby, Rails & Python. I'm trained and practised in picking up new tech efficiently & effectively. 
- Financial services background prior to tech: 5+ years in roles where being a [quantifiably fast learner](#adaptable-and-a-fast-learner) and [clear, effective communicator](#empathetic-and-effective-communicator) was absolutely paramount. 
- Trained and certified in process improvement & Business Analysis, with experience building software in that capacity.

Available at short notice for permanent positions.

## Skills

### Empathetic and Effective Communicator

My mum has always said that, as a child, she could ‘take me anywhere’ – even as a two-year-old she would find me chatting away to anyone and everyone. This is one of the traits I value most in myself and others and means I excel when working closely with people in a team.

I'm not afraid to ask for help when I need it and relish the opportunity to get [feedback](#test-driven-development) on my work. 

- Designed and delivered communication training for teams of around 20 people to aid in the transition of a major banking project from London to Leeds.
- I have also started and supported teams that dealt exclusively with the most difficult of a project’s cases - those involving the family of deceased customers in particular requiring tact and care.

### Adaptable and a Fast Learner

With regulatory compliance contracts lasting anywhere from three months to two years, often with multiple workstreams on a single contract, one of the most valuable skills I have is the ability to learn a new set of complex regulations, systems and products quickly and thoroughly. 

My ability to do this was **quantifiably tested**, with work being submitted to regular & thorough quality control checks. These **never dipped below 95%**. 

- My brother and I saw a gap in the market for a podcast focusing on the less well-known but no less fascinating people in the entertainment industry so I set about learning how to run a podcast.
- We started the Up & Coming podcast last year with no prior experience in podcasting and Season 1 has garnered thousands of listens to date. We are currently working on Season 2 and receiving requests for guest appearances.

### Comfortable and Confident Working in a Team

I have always loved working collaboratively with people, I have done so throughout my career and really enjoy the feeling of being in a team that is gelling:

- Since joining Gigfunding I have worked entirely remotely, using Wrike to track tickets and Zoom to hold meetings. This enables a team of devs spread from the UK to India and Pakistan to work together efficiently. 
- I provided close Subject Matter Expert support to a team of 14 Case Handlers for nine months; leading stand-ups and providing support on their most complex cases.
- During this time, we maintained 100% quality - with 2000+ cases worked and 200+ checked this was an unprecedented length of time for a team to go without a single incorrect decision.

### Test Driven Development

- Practically everything I build is made using Test Driven Development. I have used it since I first learned to code and it is second nature for me to use TDD when solving complex problems. 
- I continue to undergo regular assessment of my TDD process and have had nine code reviews focused on this with an independent assessment company via Makers. This is **more than almost anyone else** the reviewers are aware of. I can provide examples of feedback from these sessions on request.

## Education
